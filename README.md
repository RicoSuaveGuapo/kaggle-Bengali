## Test

Run the following command to test our training framework:

```
$ python test.py
```

Once the training is completed, see the `lightning_logs` to check losses do get smaller

```
$ tensorboard --logdir=lightning_logs/version_x
```

, where `x` is a number and indicates the latest version.

## Key points
* grapheme recall dominates
